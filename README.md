Amazon’s S3 API is the defacto standard in the object storage world. MinIO is the defacto standard for S3 compatibility and was one of the first to adopt the API and the first to add support for S3 Select. More than 750 organizations, including Microsoft Azure, use MinIO’s S3 Gateway - more than the rest of the industry combined.
